<h2>To make fried chicken, gather your ingredients (chicken pieces, flour, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, eggs, and buttermilk), whisk together the dry ingredients in one bowl and beat the eggs with buttermilk in another, dip each chicken piece into the wet batter, then coat it in the flour mixture, heat vegetable oil in a deep frying pan or Dutch oven to 350째F (175째C), carefully fry the chicken for 10-15 minutes, turning occasionally until golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C), remove the chicken, place it on paper towels to drain excess oil, let it rest for a few minutes, and serve hot with your favorite sides like mashed potatoes, coleslaw, or cornbread for a crispy, flavorful meal.</h2>
